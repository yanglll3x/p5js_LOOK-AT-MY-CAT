## 2021 MDDN342 Assignment 1: Randomised Collections

-final version-

-LOOK AT CATS-

Here are my final version of this project.

I chose cat as my character, I did some research about how to create a valid expression and how to let face looks better. Although the result might be not perfect, I still spent lots of time to decide which is better. From open eyes to open mouth, from face width and how to sketch better outline. I have compared use curveVertex, bezierVertex or quadraticVertex. 

The final arrangement, I selected a big face as main face and the other faces are surrounded by this one. There many figures and colors of cats. I selected the typical two kind types. And also for final arrangement, the 5x4 grid part cats, I use conditional randomness (both weighted selection and Gaussian selection). For bottom line part, I just used weighted selection.

Then I will show my parameters below:
1.	scale
2.	face width
3.	chin
4.	ear (for cat 1 is ear chip and for cat 2 is ear up and down)
5.	ear shift
6.	mouth
7.	open mouth
8.	eyes
9.	eyeballs
10.	color & texture
